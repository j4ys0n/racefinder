					Dear CRCA,
					<br/><br/>
					This past year serving as President of CRCA has been excellent in many ways. We put on a great season of club racing, brought back the classic Bear Mountain race and put on numerous, very competitive open races in and around NYC that have brought in some of the best talent in the region. I’ve enjoyed helping to facilitate all of this while also representing the club at regional elite races. Personally, 2014 has been the best year I’ve ever had and I’d like 2015 to be better both on and off the bike.
					<br/><br/>
					I admit - as most of the Board members were new this year, including myself - it took us a while to get off the ground and get organized. I went into this position not really knowing what to expect, but have come out it if with a great understanding of how the CRCA operates, what the pain points are and where we need to improve. Most of the troubles stem from the fact that we still use pen and paper, relying on manual calculation and a human to process results for race operations. We’ve done our best to run a tight ship on race mornings, but this has proved error-prone and too slow. I’d really like to see the CRCA come into the age of the Internet and solve and/or streamline these manual processes with the help of technology. This means could things like using timing chips for results (a la Redhook Crit), using iPads and bar code scanners for registration (we can scan your USAC license!) and using GPS to track the fields (via motos) around a course - for safety. Maybe even a smartphone app for marshaling.
					<br/><br/>
					Unfortunately, my thinking and expectations seem to be too progressive for some of the CRCA Board members and some would like me to not be involved moving forward. Ideas like I mentioned above have been deemed as excessive and some of the board members have decided, without asking the club members, that the club is not interested in any this. To be clear, the club has the funds and I think it’s about time we reinvest a small portion to improve our club. This is why I’m writing to all of you, the members of CRCA.
					<br/><br/>
					Please keep in mind the ideas mentioned above would take some time to implement and some may not be feasible (or even wanted - timing chips). But I promise to work towards helping streamline race-day processes with the use of technology if I am reelected.
					<br/><br/>
					Cheers,
					<br/><br/>
					Jayson Jacobs<br/>
					CRCA President
